# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Poptropica: Temple University Island

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game modeled after the game "Poptropica", the theme being your character trying to make their way to class for our 1051 final exam. There will likely be an obstacle/mini game or two (3?) within the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will prompt the user to move along their path towards our class building from their apartment. Along the way the user will have to interact with other people or obstacles to get to their exam on time. Mini games may be within these interactions. This will be executed likely with Unity or Pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will have set up the game with Poptropica-style graphics and a main character (the user) who will work through a narrative to achieve the end goal of getting to the exam on time. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A much better outcome would be to incorperate more than one obstacle for the user to get through. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The ideal goal for this project would include multiple obstacles including a mini game within the overall narrative of the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be going over my notes from the year to decide what level of difficulty I am comfortable creating for this game/storyline. I hope to learn the differences in Unity/Pygame and how to navigate these programs to create the game I have envisioned in my head. I will need to do a lot of research about how to cause characters to move and interact with the surroundings of the game.
